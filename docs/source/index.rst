NNMT is an open-source, community centered Python package for collecting
reusable implementations of analytical methods for neuronal network model
analysis based on mean-field theory.

Currently, the toolbox mainly contains tools for networks of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. But we have started adding methods for other models
as well. With the tools collected in NNMT you can calculate analytical
estimates of dynamical properties like mean firing rates or power spectra from
the parameters of a given network model. Other tools might help you get a
better intuitive understanding of your network model or allow mapping a model
onto another one.

NNMT is an emerging toolbox. Contributions to our `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/INM-6/nnmt>`_ can be made via the GitHub fork and pull
request workflow. Similarly, any suggestions or problems should be reported as
`issues on GitHub <https://github.com/INM-6/nnmt/issues>`_.

If you use NNMT for your project, please don't forget to

NNMT is the successor to
`lif_meanfield_tools <https://github.com/INM-6/lif_meanfield_tools>`_.
